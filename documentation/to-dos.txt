For 22/01/2018

1) See the caffe.proto file in caffe_root/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
The above file has the definitions for all the layers, maybe it is has
the syntax too, will be good to know this.

2) Start working on the visualization of the trained caffe model either in python or matlab.

3) Look into the paper of the CAE w/o pooling layers and see how they make sure that
the training parameters are the same in both encoder & decoder part.
